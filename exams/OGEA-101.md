Karthick81 1 year, 4 months ago "A. Conducting assessments of the maturity level of architecture discipline within the organization" is more specifically aligned with the responsibilities of an Architecture Board is because: Governance and Oversight: One of the primary roles of an Architecture Board is to provide governance and oversight of the architecture practice within the organization. This includes assessing the maturity of the architecture discipline to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with business goals. While "D. Establishing targets for re-use of components" is indeed a significant aspect of promoting efficient architecture practices and might be influenced by the Architecture Board, it is typically more specific and operational. The Architecture Board would generally set high-level policies and principles that encourage re-use, but the actual establishment of specific targets and their implementation might fall to other roles or bodies within the architecture function, such as architecture teams or project managers. Thus, while both A and D can be related to the Architecture Board's interests, A is more directly within the board's core responsibilities. upvoted 4 times ...

MMo001 1 year, 2 months ago A. Architecture Views, Architecture Viewpoints is the more appropriate answer: Architecture Views and Viewpoints are formal tools used within architectural frameworks like TOGAF to communicate architecture in ways that are relevant to different stakeholder groups. They allow architects to address specific stakeholder concerns by presenting different aspects of the architecture. By doing so, architects can extract deeper insights into stakeholders' needs, priorities, and any hidden agendas that might affect the architecture. Alternatives and Trade-offs, on the other hand, focus more on evaluating different architectural options and making decisions about compromises.

Comments: SangSang 6 months ago Selected Answer: C C allows responsiveness to change, faster feedback loops, and flexibility across complex environments. There is no mandatory chart type in TOGAF, Gantt is just a tool (Physical/Component layers), not a principal. TOGAF has to be iteration and flexible, multiple phases can be run in parallel in the complex world, so there is no enforcement of consequence and fix time duration. upvoted 1 times ... 044f354 11 months ago Selected Answer: C C is correct https://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/adm-practitioners/adm-practitioners_5.html#_Toc95288835 "This figure provides a process-oriented view of executing the ADM. The Gantt shows the inter-dependent nature of EA requires all ADM phases that develop a candidate architecture and test it for acceptance to be open simultaneously. The ADM phases stay open to address the information required; once it is provided they close. Also, regardless of where the Practitioner is in time or purpose or Architecture Project, if the Business Architecture is being developed the Practitioner is executing Phase B. Executing Phase B is all about addressing the stakeholder concerns from the perspective of the Business Architecture domain, identifying the gaps in the Business Architecture, and looking at impacts across the EA Landscape. The figure highlights that many of the steps in the ADM phases can be executed simultaneously." upvoted 3 times ... 044f354 11 months ago Selected Answer: B B. An Enterprise Architecture must be developed in phases with a limited fixed duration. First, TOGAF is a flexible framework. Scrutinize answers containing limiting words like "MUST". (A, C, D) (A, C, D) are all wrong because ADM phases can be run in sequence OR simultaneously, and Gantt charts are not a MUST to communicate with stakeholders. Option B offers a structured approach that includes timeboxing upvoted 2 times ... 679d5cb 12 months ago Selected Answer: C The statement "ADM phases must be run in a sequenced approach to produce the Architecture" is not entirely accurate. The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) is designed to be iterative and flexible rather than strictly sequential. While the ADM does have a sequence of phases, it's not mandatory to run them in a strict order. Phases can overlap, and activities from different phases can be carried out simultaneously to refine and gather the necessary information. This iterative and flexible approach allows for more adaptive and responsive architecture development. Hence, C. ADM phases must be run simultaneously until the relevant information has been produced better captures the dynamic nature of the ADM process upvoted 1 times ... ByeWorld 1 year, 2 months ago Selected Answer: C Answer is B: An Enterprise Architecture must be developed in phases with a limited fixed duration. Reference: https://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/adm-practitioners/adm-practitioners_5.html The Gantt shows the inter-dependent nature of EA requires all ADM phases that develop a candidate architecture and test it for acceptance to be open simultaneously. The ADM phases stay open to address the information required; once it is provided they close. upvoted 4 times ByeWorld 1 year, 2 months ago sorry typo, answer is C, not B. upvoted 3 times Naoufal18 1 year ago see where the confusion might arise. Let's clarify this point: The answer B suggests that an Enterprise Architecture must be developed in phases with a limited fixed duration, which is somewhat misleading in the context of TOGAF. The correct concept illustrated by the Architecture Roadmap is that ADM phases must be run in a sequenced approach to produce the Architecture (Answer A). The Gantt chart mentioned in the reference highlights the interdependent nature of the phases, indicating that while some activities might overlap or run concurrently, the phases themselves have a sequential flow. This does not necessarily imply a limited fixed duration but rather emphasizes the structured progression and dependency among phases. So, while the phases can have some degree of overlap to address specific requirements (as stated in the reference), the overall process is still sequenced to ensure that each phase builds upon the outcomes of the previous one, aligning with the Architecture Roadmap's purpose. upvoted 1 times ... ... ...
